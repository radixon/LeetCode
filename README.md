# LeetCode
In preparation of tech interviews, I will be completing LeetCode Problems

1. Two Sum

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

2. Contains Duplicate

Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array. And return false if every element is distinct.
