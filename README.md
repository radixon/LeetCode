In preparation of tech interviews, I will be completing LeetCode Problems

## Two Sum

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

## Contains Duplicate

Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array. And return false if every element is distinct.

## Product of Array Except Self

Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i]. <br />
The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer. <br />
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.
